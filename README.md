#Comments:

This app was a lot of fun to do.  It used MySQL, Bootstrap, CSS, and Handlebars.  Handlebars is very nice way to render from the server and I was pretty amazed that I could do this homework with it because initially I thought that the functionality would require JQuery.  The final result is pretty neat and I didn't use ANY JQuery!
This is the non-squelize version.  There is also an extended version with sequelize and an extra function.  That extended verson is here:
